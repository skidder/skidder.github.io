Hello, and welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Scott Kidder, a technology enthusiast, software engineer, and lifelong learner.

## Professional Background

I've been working in the tech industry for over 20 years, specializing in large scale distributed systems for video and media processing. Currently, I'm an Engineering Manager at [Discord](https://www.discord.com/), where I head the Media Infrastructure team responsible for handling all file-based UGC media on Discord.

My journey in tech began in 1992 when I began developing small [TI-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-BASIC) programs on for my TI-85. That kindled a passion for programming and Internet technologies. A few community college classes later, I was hooked, and went on to receive my Computer Science & Engineering degree at University of California, Davis.

Since then, I've had the opportunity to contribute to numerous video services ([MobiTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MobiTV), [Zencoder](https://www.brightcove.com/en/products/zencoder/), [Brightcove](https://www.brightcove.com/), [Mux](https://www.mux.com/), [Discord](https://www.discord.com/)), having the honor and pleasure to be an early engineer at Mux building the Mux Data & Video products from the ground up.

## This Blog

I started this blog as a way to share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings in the ever-evolving world of technology. Here, you'll find:

- Deep dives into interesting tech concepts
- Tutorials and how-to guides
- Reviews of tools and technologies I use
- Reflections on industry trends and best practices

My goal is to create content that's both informative and accessible, whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your tech journey.

## Beyond the Keyboard

When I'm not coding or writing, you can find me camping (or curating my camping gear), hiking, or exploring new uses for LLMs.

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to connect with fellow engineers and learners. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-kidder-2271041/) or [Github](https://github.com/skidder).

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful or interesting here!
