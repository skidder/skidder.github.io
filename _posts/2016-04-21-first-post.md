I've maintained a personal website of some sort since 1994. Recently I've been kept very busy, professionally and otherwise, so performing upkeep on a blog is low on my list of priorities. Enter... Github Pages. I can write my posts in Markdown, and all security & scalability issues are handled by Github.
